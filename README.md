# Project 1 Portfolio
 -This is my first Quickstart project. (Simplified portfolio)

Hello, my name is Jorge Reyes.

This project serves as my portfolio for the time being. I do intend to expand it further as I learn.

Once I have completed the bootcamp and some projects the grid in the home page would house the collection of my individual projects, the carousel serves as a showcase for upcoming projects or highlights. Contact page serves as a business inquiry section and the about me page is so that people can see the kind of person I am.

This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git, and Github.

Future plans: I have already started working on an E-commerce website that I already have up and running under Wix but plan to do the coding from scratch on my own which I will add to my portfolio after. I hope to expand the portfolio with javascript and python once I have learned that better. I also want to develop applications either in gaming or daily use apps.
